separates a Module (a Specific task into application) into three  components Model, View, and Controller. 

Model:
It is a class and its performed all kinds of data interaction with database and  tables
to add,edit ,delete & retrieve

View: 
Present data to the user or handles user interaction (click submit file upload interface)

Controller: 
Business Logic & An interface between Model and View components

View(HTML)
A View is that part of the application that represents the presentation of data.
Views are created by the data collected from the model data. A view requests the model to 
give information so that it resents the output presentation to the user.
The view represents the data from Controller

The Controller is that part of the application that handles the user interaction.

Model(PHP class to connect MySQL data & add,edit,delete,read actions with declared methods in declared Same model class)
